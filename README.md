# üß† SciMemeX: Automatic Generation of Scientific Memes from Research Articles

> **Paper**: *Breaking Bored? SciMemeX: Towards Automatic Generation of Scientific Memes from Research Articles*  
> **Framework**: Modular Multi-Agent System for Contrastive Meme Generation  
> **Key Components**: LLM-based Summarization, Template Selection, Meme Generation, and Evaluation

## üåü Overview

**SciMemeX** introduces a novel paradigm for **science communication** by automatically generating **scientific memes** from research papers.  
It leverages a **multi-agent framework** combining **idea extraction**, **template selection**, and **feedback-guided contrastive refinement** to produce memes that are:

- **Faithful** to the scientific content (scientific fidelity)  
- **Clear** in their communicative intent (clarity & interpretability)  
- **Engaging** for broader scientific audiences (engagement potential)

The system is designed to **translate dense academic insights into accessible, humorous, and memorable visual narratives**, fostering wider engagement beyond academia.

## üß© Core Components

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Concisio Agent** | Extracts comparative insights: *prior work vs. new contributions* (~100-word summary). |
| **Template Selector Agent (TSA)** | Chooses optimal meme templates for given paper ideas. |
| **Generator Agent** | Produces creative meme captions conditioned on paper content and selected templates. |
| **Contrastive Generator** | Refines memes iteratively using feedback from prior best/worst generations. |
| **Evaluation Agents** | Three LLM-as-judge evaluators for *Fidelity*, *Clarity*, and *Engagement*. |

## üß† Evaluation Dimensions

SciMemeX employs three complementary automatic evaluation metrics implemented in `eval_metrics.py`:

| Metric | Scale | Definition |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Scientific Fidelity** | 1‚Äì5 | Faithfulness to the paper‚Äôs core contribution. |
| **Clarity (FRI Score)** | 1‚Äì3 | How easily a graduate-level audience grasps the meme‚Äôs message. |
| **Engagement Potential** | 1‚Äì5 | Humor, shareability, and non-offensiveness. |
